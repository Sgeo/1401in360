# 1401in360

IBM had provided 1401 emulation for their System/360 machines. This is an attempt to get that emulation working.

## Emulators

I have two different copies of IBM's emulator:

* b1401, modified by Tom Brown in 1971
* w1401, modified by Dick Weaver in 1970, and cleaned up by [moshix](https://github.com/moshix/IBM1401), Berneard Murphy, and Gerard Postpischil

I do not have the original.
